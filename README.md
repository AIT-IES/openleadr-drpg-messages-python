# OpenLEADR DR Programming Guide Messages

This Python3 package extends [OpenLEADR](https://github.com/openleadr/openleadr-python) to send messages formated as suggested by the OpenADR DR Programming Guide.
The main difference to the way OpenLEADR implements messaging is the placement of the XML namespaces in the header.
